# jswidler challenge

In 2014, [Jesse Swidler](https://github.com/jswidler) designed a coding challenge for Okta's engineering applicants. It was initially designed for applicants to demonstrate a basic understanding of http and their ability to manage state. While an applicant was never tasked with the challenge, it became a perennial topic of conversation for some Okta engineers.

The rules are simple, but the search for a solution is a journey.

While the challenge is no longer hosted at jswidler.com/challenge, I've rebuilt the challenge so others may enjoy it. A faithful reproduction based on [the backups from the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/2016*/jswidler.com/challenge) is hosted at [jswidler.co/challenge](https://jswidler.co/challenge).
